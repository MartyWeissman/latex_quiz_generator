# LaTeX quiz generator
A Pythonic approach to writing mathematics assessments, to support reuse of questions, flexible generation of random questions, and rendering to LaTex and other formats.

This software exists to (eventually) provide the mathematical community with a powerful method of creating and sharing assessment questions.  For comparison, [PGML](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Introduction_to_PGML) and [MathObjects](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Introduction_to_MathObjects) are used to create randomizable questions within [WebWork](http://webwork.maa.org/) that can be assessed by computers.  These are based on PERL, and are oriented towards web-served assessments.  This software is written in Python, and is oriented towards rendering in LaTeX for print.
